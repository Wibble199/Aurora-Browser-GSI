# Aurora GSI for Browsers

Aurora GSI for Browsers is a browser extension that sends the current tabs and windows that the browser has open to the Aurora RGB lighting software. This allows for customisation based on the current page, for example you could light your keyboard orange on reddit, dark blue on Steam or turn the lights off when you're watching videos on YouTube.

Aurora is an open-source unified keyboard and mouse lighting software that supports many different brands of keyboards including Logitech, Roccat, Razer, Corsair and more. Visit the [Aurora website](https://www.project-aurora.com/) or come [join us on Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/YAuBmg9)!
